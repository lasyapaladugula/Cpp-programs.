# Cpp-programs.
C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs. It is an extension of the C programming language, adding support for object-oriented programming (OOP) and many advanced features that make it powerful, flexible, and efficient.
